FLAMINGO MENU APP - DEPLOY KIT

To deploy:
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g., flamingo-menu)
2. Upload these files to that repository
3. Connect the repo to Vercel.com
4. Use the Vercel-generated link for your QR code
5. Link the app to your Google Sheet (API config included)

For help, ask your dev to use React + fetch() to pull from Google Sheets published as CSV or JSON.
